## Background
Many of us think of snake as one of the first games that was available on a mobile phone (it appeared on the Nokia 6110 in 1997). But snake goes back much further than that. It’s heritage dates back to 1976, with the first version of what was then called Worm written in 1978.

## Rules
Snake is a simple game. The player controls a snake which move around the playing grid at a fixed speed. The goal is to eat food that appears at random locations on the grid.

For each item of food eaten the snake becomes longer and the player scores points. The game ends when the snake hits the edge of the game grid or it’s own body.
